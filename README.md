## Project Overview  

This project was developed as part of a **Software Development Internship Test**, requiring the implementation of a **Login System** and a **Dashboard**. My goal was to build a **scalable, well-structured, and maintainable** application following **modern frontend development best practices**.  

The solution was designed with **clean architecture principles**, ensuring **code reusability, separation of concerns, and an intuitive user experience**.  

The live version is available at: [STech - Amanda](https://stech-amanda.vercel.app/)

## Technologies Used  

To ensure **high performance, maintainability, and scalability**, I selected the following technologies:  

- **React.js** â€“ A component-based library for building UIs efficiently.  
- **Vite** â€“ A fast development and build tool optimized for performance.  
- **Material UI** â€“ A modern UI component library ensuring accessibility and design consistency.  
- **React Router DOM** â€“ Manages client-side navigation seamlessly.  
- **React Toastify** â€“ Provides user-friendly notification feedback.  
- **Styled Components** â€“ CSS-in-JS for dynamic and modular styling.  
- **Framer Motion** â€“ Enables smooth animations for an enhanced UX.
- **Zod** â€“ For schema validation, ensuring strict input validation throughout the application.
- **React-Draggable** â€“ Used for draggable elements to enhance the user experience with flexible UI components.
- **Vercel** â€“ A cloud platform for quick and efficient deployment.  
- **Git Commitizen** â€“ Enforces a **conventional commit format**, improving version control and documentation.  

Each technology was carefully selected to **maximize maintainability, performance, and user experience**.

## Features and Functionalities  

This project incorporates **key features** to enhance usability and maintainability:  

### Authentication System  
- **Login form with real-time validation** for email and password fields using Zod to validate the input formats strictly.
- **Error messages for invalid inputs**, empty fields, and incorrect formats.  
- **Toggle password visibility** for improved user experience.
- **Password requirements guidance** through **Tooltips**, which guide users on valid password format and criteria.
- **Toast notifications** providing immediate login feedback.  

### Dashboard  
- **Displays mock user data** fetched from JSONPlaceholder.  
- **Material UI cards** to present structured information clearly.
- **Collapsible sections** to display data in a clean and organized manner.
- **Pagination** added to the cards to limit the data displayed at once, improving readability and performance.
- **Responsive design**, ensuring usability across all devices.
- **Loading state handling**: To avoid showing an empty screen, loading states are displayed until images and data from the API are fully loaded.

### UI/UX Enhancements  
- **Keyboard accessibility improvements** for better usability.  
- **Smooth transitions** using Framer Motion for a polished experience.  
- **Consistent design system** using a global theme for styling.

## Architectural Decisions  

I designed this project with a **modular, scalable, and maintainable architecture**. The key principles followed include:  

### Componentization and Reusability  
- **UI components (buttons, inputs) are reusable and isolated** to prevent redundancy.  
- **Each page has its own structure**, ensuring clear separation of concerns.  

### Modularization  
- **Business logic is separate from UI logic**, improving maintainability.  
- **Validation logic is centralized**, making it easy to modify or expand.  

### State Management  
- **useState is used for local state management**, keeping the project lightweight.  
- **State lifting is applied where necessary**, ensuring a clear data flow.  

These **architectural decisions enhance maintainability, scalability, and long-term project sustainability**.

## Project Conventions and Naming Standards  

To ensure **consistency, readability, and maintainability**, I followed strict **naming conventions** and commit standards throughout the project:  

### Naming Conventions  
- **Folders**: Named using **kebab-case** (e.g., pages, components/input-field).  
- **JavaScript Files**: Named using **camelCase** (e.g., validation.js).  
- **React Components**: Named using **PascalCase** (e.g., InputField.jsx).  
- **Styled Components**: Follow the **same name as the component file**, keeping a **1:1 mapping** between style and component (e.g., InputField.jsx and styles.js).  
- **Theme Variables**: Defined in theme.js, ensuring **consistent design system usage** across all components.  
- **Global Styles**: Managed in GlobalStyles.js using **Styled Components**, enforcing uniform styling.  

### Commit Message Standardization  
To maintain a **clear and structured commit history**, I integrated **Git Commitizen** to enforce **Conventional Commits**.  

#### Commit Format  
<type>(<scope>): <short description>
[optional blank line]
<long description (if necessary)>


#### Explanation of Elements:

1. **Commit Types**:  
   <details> <summary>The standardized commit types are (click here to expand):</summary>
    
     - **refactor**: Refactoring code without changing functionality.  
     - **feat**: Adding a new feature.
     - **fix**: Fixing a bug.  
     - **chore**: Maintenance tasks or tasks that don't affect the functionality (e.g., updating dependencies).  
     - **docs**: Documentation updates.  
     - **style**: Code style changes that do not affect functionality (e.g., formatting, semicolons).  
     - **test**: Adding or modifying tests.  
     - **perf**: Performance improvements.  
     - **ci**: Continuous integration changes (e.g., CI configuration updates).  
     - **build**: Changes related to the build system or external dependencies.  
     - **wip**: Work in progress.
       
  </details>

2. **Scope** (optional but recommended):
   - Specifies the area of code changed (e.g., (login), (input-component), (styles)).

3. **Short Description**: 
   - A concise and objective phrase explaining the change.  

4. **Long Description** (optional):
   - Additional details about the change, including why and how it was implemented.

#### Example Commit Messages:
sh
git commit -m "feat(validation): add email validation to login form"
git commit -m "fix(button): correct padding issue on submit button"
git commit -m "refactor(inputComponent): modularize input component code"


This ensures **readability, better tracking of changes, and a standardized workflow**.

## Final Considerations  

This project demonstrates my ability to:  
- **Architect a scalable frontend system** using modern technologies.  
- **Implement best practices in clean code, modularization, and componentization**.  
- **Standardize naming conventions and commit messages** for better maintainability.  
- **Deploy and manage a React application effectively using Vercel**.  

By prioritizing **code quality, maintainability, and user experience**, I ensured this project aligns with **industry standards** for frontend development.
