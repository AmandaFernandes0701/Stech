## Project Overview
This project was developed as part of a Software Development Internship Test, requiring the implementation of a Login System and a Dashboard. My goal was to build a scalable, well-structured, and maintainable application following modern frontend development best practices.

The solution was designed with clean architecture principles, ensuring code reusability, separation of concerns, and an intuitive user experience.

## Technologies Used
To ensure high performance, maintainability, and scalability, I selected the following technologies:

- **React.js** â€“ A component-based library for building UIs efficiently.
- **Vite** â€“ A fast development and build tool optimized for performance.
- **Material UI** â€“ A modern UI component library ensuring accessibility and design consistency.
- **React Router DOM** â€“ Manages client-side navigation seamlessly.
- **React Toastify** â€“ Provides user-friendly notification feedback.
- **Styled Components** â€“ CSS-in-JS for dynamic and modular styling.
- **Framer Motion** â€“ Enables smooth animations for an enhanced UX.
- **Zod** â€“ Schema-based validation for form inputs.
- **React Draggable** â€“ Allows drag-and-drop functionality for UI elements.
- **Tooltip** â€“ Displays password validation rules in a user-friendly way.
- **Vercel** â€“ A cloud platform for quick and efficient deployment.
- **Git Commitizen** â€“ Enforces a conventional commit format, improving version control and documentation.

Each technology was carefully selected to maximize maintainability, performance, and user experience.

### Authentication System
- Login form with real-time validation for email and password fields.
- Error messages for invalid inputs, empty fields, and incorrect formats.
- Toggle password visibility for improved user experience.
- Tooltip with password validation criteria.
- Toast notifications providing immediate login feedback.

### Dashboard
- Displays mock user data fetched from JSONPlaceholder.
- Material UI cards to present structured information clearly.
- Responsive design, ensuring usability across all devices.
- Drag-and-drop functionality using React Draggable.

### UI/UX Enhancements

## Architectural Decisions
I designed this project with a modular, scalable, and maintainable architecture. The key principles followed include:

### Componentization and Reusability
- UI components (buttons, inputs) are reusable and isolated to prevent redundancy.
- Each page has its own structure, ensuring clear separation of concerns.

### Modularization
- Business logic is separate from UI logic, improving maintainability.
- Validation logic is centralized, making it easy to modify or expand.

### State Management
- `useState` is used for local state management, keeping the project lightweight.
- State lifting is applied where necessary, ensuring a clear data flow.

These architectural decisions enhance maintainability, scalability, and long-term project sustainability.

## Project Conventions and Naming Standards
To ensure consistency, readability, and maintainability, I followed strict naming conventions and commit standards throughout the project:

### Naming Conventions
- **Folders**: Named using kebab-case (e.g., `pages`, `components/input-field`).
- **JavaScript Files**: Named using camelCase (e.g., `validation.js`).
- **React Components**: Named using PascalCase (e.g., `InputField.jsx`).
- **Styled Components**: Follow the same name as the component file, keeping a 1:1 mapping between style and component (e.g., `InputField.jsx` and `styles.js`).
- **Theme Variables**: Defined in `theme.js`, ensuring consistent design system usage across all components.
- **Global Styles**: Managed in `GlobalStyles.js` using Styled Components, enforcing uniform styling.

### Commit Message Standardization
To maintain a clear and structured commit history, I integrated Git Commitizen to enforce Conventional Commits.

### Commit Types

   - Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user authentication.
   - Implement a database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL) to store user data and dashboard information.

### 2. **Accessibility Enhancements**
   - Ensure all components are fully accessible using ARIA attributes.
   - Add keyboard navigation support for all interactive elements.
   - Conduct accessibility audits using tools like **Lighthouse** or **axe**.

### 3. **Testing**
   - Add unit tests using **Jest** and **React Testing Library**.
   - Implement end-to-end testing with **Cypress**.
   - Use snapshot testing to ensure UI consistency.

## Final Considerations
This project demonstrates my ability to:

- Architect a scalable frontend system using modern technologies.
- Implement best practices in clean code, modularization, and componentization.
- Standardize naming conventions and commit messages for better maintainability.
- Deploy and manage a React application effectively using Vercel.

By prioritizing code quality, maintainability, and user experience, I ensured this project aligns with industry standards for frontend development.
