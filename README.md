## Project Overview  

This project was developed as part of a **Software Development Internship Test**, where I was required to build a **Login System** and a **Dashboard** with a well-structured architecture, maintainable code, and a seamless user experience.  

I designed this solution focusing on **clean code principles, modularization, componentization, and efficient state management**. The application follows a **modern UI/UX approach**, ensuring a responsive and intuitive interface.  

The live version of the project can be accessed at: [STech - Amanda](https://stech-amanda.vercel.app/)

## Technologies Used  

To ensure performance, scalability, and maintainability, I selected the following technologies:  

- **React.js** â€“ Component-based UI development.  
- **Vite** â€“ Fast build tool optimizing development speed.  
- **Material UI** â€“ Pre-styled UI components with accessibility in mind.  
- **React Router DOM** â€“ Client-side routing for smooth navigation.  
- **React Toastify** â€“ User-friendly notifications for login status.  
- **Styled Components** â€“ CSS-in-JS approach for dynamic styling.  
- **Framer Motion** â€“ Subtle UI animations enhancing user experience.  
- **Vercel** â€“ Serverless platform for rapid deployment.  

Each technology was chosen to align with **industry best practices**, prioritizing **performance, modularization, and scalability**.

## Features and Functionalities  

I implemented the following functionalities to ensure a seamless and secure user experience:  

### Authentication System  
- **Login form with validation** for email and password.  
- **Error handling** for invalid credentials, empty fields, and incorrect formats.  
- **Toast notifications** to provide real-time user feedback.  
- **Toggle visibility for password input** for improved UX.  

### Dashboard  
- **Displays mock user data** using JSONPlaceholder.  
- **Material UI cards** to structure information efficiently.  
- **Fully responsive layout**, ensuring usability across all devices.  

### UI/UX Enhancements  
- **Smooth animations** for transitions and interactive elements.  
- **Form validation with instant feedback** before API requests.  
- **Keyboard accessibility improvements** for better usability.  

Every feature is **intentionally implemented** to optimize **usability, performance, and maintainability**.

## Architectural Decisions  

I structured this project with a strong emphasis on **scalability, readability, and maintainability**.  

### Componentization and Reusability  
- All UI elements (buttons, inputs, modals) are **abstracted into reusable components**.  
- The form fields leverage a **generic InputField component** to **prevent code repetition**.  

### Modularization  
- Code is **divided into logical modules** for better separation of concerns.  
- **Business logic, UI logic, and styles are clearly separated** to improve maintainability.  

### State Management  
- **useState is used for local state management**, eliminating unnecessary complexity.  
- **State lifting is applied where necessary** to ensure optimal data flow.  

These architectural choices enhance **scalability and ease of maintenance**, ensuring the project remains **robust and future-proof**.

```

The directory structure ensures **separation of concerns, reusability, and maintainability**.

## Error Handling and Validation  

I implemented **robust error handling** and validation mechanisms to ensure stability.  

### Form Validation  
- **Email validation using regex** to ensure proper formatting.  
- **Password validation** requiring a minimum of 6 characters.  
- **Real-time error messages** displayed using React state.  

### API Error Handling  
- **try-catch blocks implemented** for all API requests.  
- **Graceful fallback messages** for failed API responses.  
- **Loading state management** to prevent duplicate submissions.  

These error handling mechanisms significantly improve **reliability and user experience**.

## Deployment Process  

The project is deployed using **Vercel**, selected for its **simplicity, speed, and automated CI/CD integration**.  

### Deployment Steps  
1. Install the **Vercel CLI**:  
   ```sh  
   npm install -g vercel  
   ```  
2. Deploy the project:  
   ```sh  
   vercel --prod  
   ```  
3. The project is now accessible at:  
   **https://stech-amanda.vercel.app/**  

For continuous deployment, the **GitHub repository is integrated with Vercel**, ensuring automatic deploys upon new commits.
